<h1 id="how-it-all-started">How it all started</h1>

<p>Well, I’ve been looking around for some place to write and I have been
interested in static site generators for a while. Well, I’ve been mostly
reading about them, and I haven’t been doing much in them, other than
small tests.</p>

<p>I saw that <a href="http://github.com">github</a> hosts pages on their 
<a href="http://github.io">github.io</a> site, and that they are using 
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> and I was thinking I just go for the standard.
So here I am, I find a nice theme to build on. And now I’ll try to make something.</p>
