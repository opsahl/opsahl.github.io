# How it all started

Well, I've been looking around for some place to write and I have been
interested in static site generators for a while. Well, I've been mostly
reading about them, and I haven't been doing much in them, other than
small tests.

I saw that [github](http://github.com) hosts pages on their 
[github.io](http://github.io) site, and that they are using 
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I was thinking I just go for the standard.
So here I am, I find a nice theme to build on. And now I'll try to make something.
