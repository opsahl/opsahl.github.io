About me
========

I'm a serial hobbyist, and IT-Worker. And if you're wanting to know something
about me, I guess hobbies are a good as any place to start.

Programming
-----------

I really enjoy programming, and it's something that I've been playing
aroung with for years, I've been having fun with quite a lot of languages,
probably more than I'd even care to count. Python, elixir, cpp, factor, forth, java etc.
I haven't really made anything big, but I enjoy messing aroung with it.

Language learning
-----------------

Learning languages has been something that I've been doing as long as I can remember,
it's something I really enjoy doing, and usually I keep having some language going.
The languages that I speak, at least to some degree are:

* Norwegian
* English
* German
* Japanese

And in addition I can read and understand:

* Danish
* Swedish
* Dutch

Speed cubing
------------

I also enjoy playing with rubik's cubes, I'm solving using the roux method
and I'm pretty slow at the time being at least, using around 40s for the 3x3,
and considerably more on 4x4 and 5x5

Reading
-------

Reading is another thing that I'm liking a lot, mainly I'm reading sci-fi and

fantasy, you can see what I've been reading lately on [my goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1282429-sotolf-flasskjegg)
