# Yash: Yet another short hand.

## Introduction

I've been interested in shorthand for quite some time, and I've taught myself [Gregg shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_shorthand)
and to a degree also [Teeline shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeline_Shorthand). These are both super shorthands, even though
I prefer Gregg, it's just cleaner, and looks a lot better. So what's the problem? I already know shorthand, so why have I bothered making
another one? The problem with both of them are that they are exclusively handwritten, which mean for most of the time, where I'm writing
on my phone or the PC I can't use it.


## The alternatives

There are other written shorthands, such as [keyscript](http://www.freewebs.com/cassyjanek/) and others, but they are something one either
has to pay for, or it's using letters that are hard to reach on many keyboards, such as / \ < | or excessive use of numbers, something
that makes one have to stretch ones fingers a lot while writing. So I have tried to make something that works for me, and that one can
write on most keyboards without much trouble, this means that I'm keeping to the letters in the English alphabet, as these seem to be
more or less the lowest common denominator.

## The basics and alphabet

Written English is chaotic, it has so many ways to write words that it gets confusing, so we'll reduce the alphabet to the letters
that we actually need, and then we'll write words phonetically, this way we have freed some letters for other use, and we have already
compacted our writing a bit. The letters that we use in yash are:

    a b d e f g h i k l m n o p r s t u v 

We're left with some letters that will get their own use later, namely:

    c j q x y w z

None of these letters are used often enough, or can't be replaced with combinations, so here are the ways we'd write the letters that are
missing:

| c | Is replaced with an s or a k according to the sound it makes |
| j | Is mostly replaced with i                                    |
| q | Is written k or kv                                           |
| x | Is written with ks                                           |
| y | Is written with i                                            |
| w | Is written with v
| z | Is written with ts                                           |

So now we have a reduced alphabet, and we also have some free letters. These letters are given new meanings in yash, mostly combinations
of 2 letters or a sound that occurs often, so that it's worth replacing it.

| c | Is used for **sh** like should in (sh)ould                |
| j | Is the harder **j/tch** sound like in ju(dge) and ca(tch) |
| q | Is used for **ng/ing**                                    |
| x | Is used for **nd/nt**                                     |
| y | Is used for **th**                                        |
| w | Is used for **rt/rd/lt/ld/td**                                        |
| z | Is used for **st**                                        |


This allows us to shorten down words quite a bit, so with these two basic things out of the way we have a couple of principles left.

## Omission of vowels

Most of the times words are pretty easy to read without vowels, so we'll mostly leave them out writing yash, with a couple of exceptions:

- Diphthongs are written with the main vowel, *great* for example would be written gret
- When one feels that the word would be unclear without the vowels one can put in vowels to make it clearer

## Phrasing

We will phrase together short words and phrases so that we won't need to push the space bar after every single letter. This way something
like "it will be" will be phrased together to tlb, we'll also phrase the (y) together with the word that it describes, and also do the same
with a, this way we can cram our text together a bit more, and it will be quicker to write.


## Examples

I'll write some examples here to try and show that yash can shorten down texts quite a bit, and it's still not that complicated to figure
out what it's supposed to be.

**Some shorthand systems attempted to ease learning by using characters from the Latin alphabet. Such non-stenographic systems 
have often been described as alphabetic, and purists might claim that such systems are not 'true' shorthand. However, these 
alphabetic systems do have value for students who cannot dedicate the years necessary to master a stenographic shorthand.
Alphabetic shorthands cannot be written at the speeds theoretically possible with symbol systems—200 words per minute or 
more—but require only a fraction of the time to acquire a useful speed of between 60 and 100 words per minute.**
